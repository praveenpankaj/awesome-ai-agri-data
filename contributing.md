# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone!

If you know of a dataset, tool, project, model, or resource that should be included in this hub, feel free to contribute. You can either open a **pull request** or create an **issue** for discussion.

---

## 📌 Contribution Rules

- ✅ Please only add **One link per Pull Request** – this makes reviews easier.
- ✅ Choose the appropriate section under `/datasets`, `/knowledge`, or other directories.
- ✅ Add the link in this format:

  [Dataset Name](http://example.com/) – A short and concise description.

- ❗ If the resource doesn't fit any existing section, please open an issue suggesting a new category.
- 🔍 **Search existing issues or PRs** before submitting a new one to avoid duplicates.
- ✍️ Check your **spelling and grammar**.
- 🧹 Remove any **trailing whitespace** or formatting issues.
- 📄 Prefer official, stable sources (DOIs, institutional links, GitHub releases, etc.).
